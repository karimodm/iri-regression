Feature: Test API calls on Machine 2
	Test various api calls to make sure they are responding
	correctly 
	
	@nodeInfo
	Scenario: GetNodeInfo is called
		Given "getNodeInfo" is called on each node in "machine2" 
		Then a response with the following is returned:
		|keys								|
		|appName							|	
		|appVersion							|
		|duration							|
		|jreAvailableProcessors				|
		|jreFreeMemory						|
		|jreMaxMemory						|
		|jreTotalMemory						|
		|jreVersion							|		
		|latestMilestone					|
		|latestMilestoneIndex				|
		|latestSolidSubtangleMilestone		|
		|latestSolidSubtangleMilestoneIndex |
		|milestoneStartIndex				|
		|neighbors							|
		|packetsQueueSize					|
		|time								|
		|tips								|
		|transactionsToRequest				|
	
	@nodeInfo	
	Scenario: Log GetNodeInfo
		Given a response for "getNodeInfo" exists
		Then create the log directory "./tests/features/machine2/static_test_logs/get_node_info_logs/"
		And log the response to the file "getNodeInfoLog.txt"		 
		
	@neighbors
	Scenario: GetNeighbors is called
		Given "getNeighbors" is called on each node in "machine2"
		Then a response with the following is returned:
		|keys								|
		|address							|
		|numberOfAllTransactions			|
		|numberOfAllTransactionRequests		|
		|numberOfNewTransactions			|
		|numberOfInvalidTransactions		|
		|numberOfSentTransactions			|
		|connectionType						|
		
	@neighbors
	Scenario: Log GetNeighbors
		Given a response for "getNeighbors" exists
		Then create the log directory "./tests/features/machine2/static_test_logs/get_neighbors_logs/"
		And log the neighbor response to the file "getNeighborsLog.txt"		 
		
	@getTips	
	Scenario: GetTips is called
		Given "getTips" is called on each node in "machine2"
		Then a response with the following is returned:
		|keys 								|
		|hashes								|
		|duration							|
	@getTips 	
	Scenario: Log GetTips
		Given a response for "getTips" exists
		Then create the log directory "./tests/features/machine2/static_test_logs/get_tips_logs/"
		And log the tips response to the file "getTipsLog.txt"

	@getTrytes
	Scenario: GetTrytes is called 
		Given getTrytes is called with the hash static_vals.TEST_HASH
		Then the response should be equal to static_vals.TEST_TRYTES
	
#	
#	@transactionsToApprove	
#	Scenario: GetTransactionsToApprove is called
#		Given "getTransactionsToApprove" is called on "nodeA"
#		Then a response with the following is returned: 
#		|keys								|
#		|trunkTransaction					|
#		|branchTransaction					|
#		|duration							|
		
	@neighbors
	Scenario: Add and remove Neighbors
		Given 2 neighbors are added with "addNeighbors" on each node in "machine2"
		When "getNeighbors" is called, it should return the following neighbor addresses:
			|neighbors 						|
			|178.128.236.6:14600 			|
			|167.99.178.3:14600				|
		Then "removeNeighbors" will be called to remove the same neighbors 
		And "getNeighbors" should not return the following neighbor addresses:
			|neighbors 						|
			|178.128.236.6:14600 			|	
			|167.99.178.3:14600				|
